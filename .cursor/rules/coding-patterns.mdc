- Always prefer simple solutions

- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for 
other parts of the codebase that might already have similar code and
functionality

- Both tests and feature code should be split into separate files for 
test, and prod

- Only permitted to only make changes that are requested or you are
confident will be understood and related to the task requested

- When fixing an issue, you should not introduce a new pattern or
architecture. Consider first exhausting all options for the existing 
implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old
implementation afterward so we don't have two ways of doing the same
thing.

- Keep the codebase very clean and organized

- Avoid putting code in file if possible; especially if the script
is likely to be imported

- Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor at that point.

- Mocking data is only needed when it makes sense for your topic.
